## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

According to the p values from linear regression vehicle length and ground clearance provided the non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not zero because the p value is much less than 0.05.


### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

**The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?**
According to the statistical summary table for all manufacturing lots we can see that the variance is 62.30 which is within the range of required variance 1oo pounds per square inch (PSI).
Similarly if we look at the another table that has individual lot summary we can see that the variance of lot1 and lot2 are both less than 100 but the variance of lot3(170.3) is more than 100.
