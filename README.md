## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

According to the p values from linear regression vehicle length and ground clearance provided the non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not zero because the p value is much less than 0.05.


### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
